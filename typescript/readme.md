## learning Typescript
A superset of javascript, Need to know about data types
### why typescript?
- Typescript does compile time execution.
- Larger codebases are easier to manage in typescript


## features
Once you declare a variable with a particular type, you cannot change it.
main reason to use TS is to make use of types to every variable
interfaces are a great use for repeated objects with same types. You can inherit the interface and reduce code.
Union operators are used for optional data types or values when fetching data or assigning a variable to a value



## notes
adding a prefix `I` or a postfix `Interface` in Interfaces to identify them in large codebase
